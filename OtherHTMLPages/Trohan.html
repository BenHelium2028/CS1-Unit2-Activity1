The bartender asks "hey, why the long face? Are you depressed?"

The horse ponders for a second, scratches his chin, and says "I don't think I am" and promptly disappears.

You see, this is a joke about Rene Descartes' famous statement "I think, therefore I am" and I could have mentioned this at the start of the joke, but that would be putting Descartes before the horse.

A horse walks into a bar.
And, y'know, it's a joke. The horse is allowed in the bar, so that's fine
So this horse, he walks into the bar.
It doesn't matter that it's a boy horse  - it could be a girl horse or whatever.
Um, not important to the joke.
So th-the horse, he walks into the bar and-
and y' know, he walks up to the the barkeep.
There's y'know the guy behind the  counter. It's an old timey saloon type bar.
Um, you know Wild West sort of, sort of thing.
So so the horse he walks into the bar
and he walks up to the barkeep um
and he says uh because it's a talking horse
it's it's the horse can talk
it's very important to the the  joke that the horse can talk
so this talking horse - again important,  very important it's a talking horse.
the the talking horse walks into the bar
and he walks up to the  barkeep and and and he says-
well before he says anything  to the barkeep he puts  
he takes his hoof and he puts it up onto the bar
um and and

but it's fine it's it's a joke um and and
oh also the the the horse because  you know his his hoof is is bloody
and it's injured he's he's limping

and and he puts his hoof up onto the bar
uh it it's bleeding, again the limping horse
let me try that again
uh the horse limps into the bar
and the horse limps limps up to the barkeep
so and and again remember the horse can talk  because it's a joke um it's very important um
so the horse walks into a bar- limps into a bar
the horse walk- horse limps into the bar
uh and and the horse walks-  limps, limps up to the barkeep
his bloody hoof up onto the bar
and he says to the bartender,

and it's a dog it's not a horse that's the kind  of, you know, it's really important the joke
um so the dog walks into the bar
and he walks up- limps, limping, limping dog
the the dog has a bloody hoof - that's  silly dog dogs don't have hooves

he's got a bloody paw um and and and and

and he he walks - limps -  the dog limps into the bar
and the dog limps up to the barkeep
and and the the talking dog  because again he can still talk
and it it still doesn't matter that  it's a boy dog girl dog or whatever
um none of that matters
but it does matter that the dog can talk
the dog's allowed in the bar uh and and and
